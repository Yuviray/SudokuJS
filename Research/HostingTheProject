// no code needs to be changed except for the login credentials
// this is just to explain a little bit about how er are going to be hosting the website.

The hosting service we will be using is infinityfree.com
I have already made an account
I have made a sql database on the hosting service and have run some test files to see if it works
Setting up the database is done in the same as the way we set the database on out personal machines
all that need to be done now is refactoring the project so that it runs smoothly on the hosting site.
